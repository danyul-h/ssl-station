For interested volunteers who are not available during our summer camp weeks, we offer similar service learning volunteer opportunities for small groups - including student groups, families, and other organizations/companies.The three-week summer camp (that happens annually - typically the last week of June through the first two weeks of July) includes fun games, activities, and literacy and math enrichment. The camp contributes to preventing summer learning loss and offers BECA's students an enriching opportunity during a time when many of their peers are still in school (public schools in Honduras operate on a February - November schedule). Our camp counselors and Counselors in Training learn just as much as our students do and have just as much fun too.",
            "Our counselors are a wonderfully varied group - including recent high school graduates, current college students on summer vacation, educators looking for service learning summer opportunities, and even retirees from all over the world.",

We ask that you contribute or fundraise $1,500 for the BECA program to help defray costs (staff support, food, accommodation, and training). A limited number of reduced contribution slots may be available. If you are interested in a service learning experience for your group, we are happy to discuss a fee structure that makes sense for all. We can also help groups/individuals set up a fundraising page using our networkforgood platform.",

            "What Volunteers Do",
            "Anyone can become a volunteer! There is no minimum age requirement. This is a great way to start earning SSL hours in middle school. Students bake cakes in their homes. Cakes must meet the container guidelines which are outlined on www.bc4f.org. The decoration/flavor/design of your cake(s) is up to you but we would prefer if you could write \u201cHappy Birthday!\u201d on your cake(s). You can make a cake from a cake mix or your favorite recipe. Round, square or rectangle cakes are all okay as long as they are individually and securely boxed, with lids taped for transport. We also accept cupcakes. Twenty-four cupcakes are equivalent to one cake. Cake requirements are posted on our website. ALL decorations MUST be edible. https://www.bc4f.org/faq",
            "How to Sign-Up to Bake CakesYou must sign-up for our Newsletter in order to receive the Google Form to sign-up to bake cakes. To subscribe, go to https://www.bc4f.org/newsletter. DO NOT USE an MCPS email address as all external emails are blocked. Once a month, you will receive information about delivery dates, delivery address, and delivery times. Currently, we accept cake donations on one Sunday a month. Our current delivery location is in Rockville. The Google Form is included in the monthly Newsletter so that you can sign-up with the number of cakes you would like to donate. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF CAKES DONATED IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE MORE VOLUNTEERS. The SSL form is provided at the time/date of cake delivery as long as the cake(s) meet donation requirements. SSL hours are awarded as follows:1 cake (or 24 cupcakes) = 2 total SSL hours 2 cakes (or 48 cupcakes) = 3 total SSL hours 3 cakes (or 72 cupcakes) = 4 total SSL hours 4 cakes (or 96 cupcakes) = 5 total SSL hours 5 cakes (or 120 cupcakes) = 6 total SSL hours 6 cakes (or 144 cupcakes) = 7 total SSL hours 7 cakes (or 168 cupcakes) = 8 total SSL hoursImportantly: While we welcome all cake donations, students may only earn SSL hours for baking and decorating their own cakes. Store bought cakes are not accepted. Additionally, SSL hours may NOT be earned for transporting cakes. No more than 8 SSL hours can be awarded to our volunteer bakers at each drop off date. To sign up, please visit https://www.bc4f.org/newsletter and subscribe to our newsletter.Please Note: DO NOT SIGN-UP FOR THE NEWSLETTER WITH AN MCPS EMAIL ADDRESS. You will not be able to receive the Newsletter with cake delivery information because MCPS blocks external emails. Follow us on Instagram @bc4fmaryland.Check out our website https://www.bc4f.org/.Student participation in this service project is at the discretion of the student's parent/guardian. The nonprofit organization is responsible for maintaining student safety and privacy at any time the student is interacting with the nonprofit and its clients.

This service activity is designed to be completed within the safety of the student's home."

            "Find, learn, and play all styles of music that have great meaning for the seniors (songs from 1940's to 1990's). Bring them to senior facilities and to hospitals during the Winter season, including Holidays in December-May. Use the time you would ordinarily spend practicing your regular songs to learn at least one or two of seniors' favorite songs. You will be really surprised by the appreciation from seniors and hospital visitors. They will smile and hum the tunes when they hear their favorite music from bygone years. Add winter and holiday repertoire to your list of music: music of their youth will be so very uplifting to them. You will be (1) performing these songs in-person, (2) and/or making a video of the songs you have learned (public domain only for videos) to place on the Playlist for hospitals. Send to: recording.thetacyfoundation@gmail.com. MCPS requires that students earn SSL hours for the time spent performing (or recording), not for the time spent practicing or rehearsing. Design Seasonal Cards for hospital patients and seniors. Make these generic to be received by any of the recipients above. Due date TBD. When we ship QR code Cards, we will place your message and card in the box for the hospitals where we play live music: Holy Cross Silver Spring, Holy Cross Germantown, Walter Reed NMMC Fisher Houses, National Institutes of Health, Suburban Hospital (Hopkins), Sibley Memorial Hospital (Hopkins), Frederick Health, Shady Grove Adventist Hospital, and Howard General Hospital (Hopkins). You will need paper and paint/crayons/colored pencils for this. Whatever art supplies you have will be fine. Make these cards generic without reference to religious belief. Hospitals request this. (1 SSL hour for 15 cards). Write to: cards.thetacyfoundation@gmail.com for information and answer to your questions.Please do not include any personal information (full name, home address, phone number, email address, etc.Make and send your music video of music (nonreligious) on YouTube. We will offer your music to the Activity Directors (of seniors facilities) as Virtual Live Performance. You are allowed to speak clearly your message to seniors: \u201cThank you for all that you have done for the community. I would like to play this song for you now.....\u201d Send to recording.thetacyfoundation@gmail.com. The length of the video should be 15-20 minutes of music at least. 1 SSL hour per completed, accepted, and uploaded Video.",

Maybe a family had just heard a very sad prognosis, or a family was happily bringing home a newborn baby, a family was bringing home a loved one from a hospital stay. As they always do, they stopped to hear your music. Another time, perhaps you saw people enter the lobby through the big doors and turn toward the music and sigh a deep breath of hope and courage. Write a descriptive piece on this. Holidays and birthdays are very mixed. They are markers of family traditions with joys and sorrows. Your writing may bring peace of mind to someone in a senior facility or a hospital who cannot express the sadness or the despair or the joy of a surprise visit of a loved one. Stories are the best medicine for reminding us of the inestimable value of paying forward our hope for others through music. (1 SSL hour).

Your writing may reflect (1) a change in your idea of community service, (2) what you discovered that you did not know before you taught (Write about this in regard to the children whom you are serving), and/or (3) the importance of music in the lives of the children you are working with. It may include a particularly difficult challenge that you faced or are facing in working with children. The piece may be about how you discovered a side of yourself you had not known before these music classes.

            "The JCA Heyman Interages Center is looking for volunteers to join us this winter for an award-winning, evidence-based, intergenerational art-making program called Opening Minds Through Art (OMA). We are looking for volunteers interested in supporting JCA's Kensington Club members (older adults with early stages of memory loss) as they create abstract art projects that engage the mind and break through cognitive barriers. We also are looking for volunteers to work alongside JCA staff to serve art supplies, provide artistic choices as well as help with set-up and clean-up. OMA is a failure-free program designed to provide older adults with opportunities for creative self-expression and social engagement. The following six dates led by trained OMA facilitators will be held at the JCA in Rockville and are required to participate. SSL hours apply. Please contact rlanman@accessjca.org for further details. Friday, February 21 from 9:30 AM - 12 pm: Volunteer training Fridays, February 28, March 7, 14, and 21 from 9:45 am - 12:15 pm: OMA art classes Sunday, March 30 from 12:30 - 2:30 PM: Art Show",

            "We look for volunteers ages 16 and up interested in working one-on-one with students on Saturday mornings from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM in Downtown Silver Spring (8700 Georgia Ave, Suite #500). LSF staff provides lesson plans and guidance, so all tutors have to bring is enthusiasm and dedication. We have permanent tutors, assigned to a student/s and expected to come every week, Back-up tutors who expect to come every week but not assigned to a student/s, and floaters who we call on only when we need extra tutors (which is most weeks).",
            "All tutors, new and returning, must complete our LSF Tutor Sign-Up Form. The form contains MANDATORY training in Khan Academy, ReadWorks, Native Language Literacy initiative, as well as Early Literacy Initiative training for those working with students in PreK through 2rd grade. This Fall, we will be using several programs during our tutoring sessions, including Khan Academy, ReadWorks, and Duolingo or Quizlet. Students and tutors should be using these materials during the tutoring session, so it's important that you understand how to use all of the programs. You will need to complete the form by answering a questionnaire, watching the training videos, and completing a brief quiz. If you are planning to work with a student between the grades of PreK through 2rd grade, the entire form will take about two hours to complete due to the Early Literacy Initiative component. If you would prefer to work with a student in 3th grade or above, the form will take about an hour to complete.",
            "Please watch ALL the training videos in their entirety. Many things have changed, even if you tutored with us virtually this Summer, so it is crucial you watch all of the videos and have a deep understanding of how our tutoring sessions will be conducted this Fall. If you would like to watch the videos before beginning the form, to save time, you can access the videos here on our LSF Tutor Resource Padlet. Here is the LSF Tutor Sign-Up 2024-2025 We will contact you if any of the comprehension questions are incorrect so that you can revisit the training. In order to be paired with a student, please complete the form to be added to our floater/substitute tutor \u201cpool\u201d and can still join us each Saturday.

In addition to the farmstead, the Park includes a 39-acre parcel on the western edge of the farm that was once home to a kinship-based African American community called Newmantown. The Farm Park has many visitors, and volunteers who have a love of history will assist staff in helping visitors connect to the history of the Farm Park through special events and programs.This opportunity is for individuals who would assist the Farm Park with its special events and programs, as needed, held throughout the year including the Harvest Festival and Montgomery County's Heritage Days. Individuals would help with set-up and clean-up; and assist staff with various duties and tasks at special events and/or programs.This is perfect for someone who doesn't want to volunteer on a regular basis, but can pitch in when needed!Training will be provided.

Training will be provided through virtual meetings and a Khan Academy course on internet safety (https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/internet-safety). The virtual meetings for training will be held on Google Meets and the point of contact from Science is Elemental for this opportunity will be on all the training calls. The Khan Academy course is a series of asynchronous (no direct interaction between instructor and student) videos that can be done a little at a time or all at once, and students will receive 2 SSL hours for completing the course, as it took me about two hours to complete it. They will need to show a screen shot of the completion page, and of each of the intermediate question page with their answers to receive the 2 SSL hours.",
            "Students will be awarded 1 SSL for adding two adjudicated science education websites to the spreadsheet in the shared folder, as it takes about 20 minutes to adjudicate a website, and it takes a little time to find websites to adjudicate.

The BCCRS junior members will participate in vocational training courses that certify them as an Emergency Medical Technician or Firefighter. They will be exposed to a professional environment with high service expectations where they will be expected to work side-by-side with adult members. They will be exposed to 911 calls ranging from the mundane to life-saving events. We know this provides an unparalleled growth opportunity to develop critical thinking and life-skills for the right teenager. It is not for everyone. Teenagers who are involved in highly competitive sports programs with inflexible requirements or have extensive extra-curricular activities which either the teen or parent judges are a higher priority than BCCRS membership and training requirements are not be a good fit for our program. All training is provided free of charge and may occur at various locations including the Public Services Training Academy near the Montgomery County Airpark.",
            "In order to begin volunteering at the BCCRS, you need to be at least 16. If you are between 16 and 18 years old, you are considered a Junior Member. Requirements for Junior Members are somewhat different than for someone who joins at 18, but you will be able to progress through EMT class and Firefighter 1 and 2 for those who want to learn firefighter and technical rescue skills before turning 18.",
            "Minimum Qualifications",
            "Junior members must have reached their 16th birthday, and not yet reached the second semester of their junior year of high school. Possess strong organization skills, ability to follow-through on commitments, attention to detail and the ability to be on-time and follow directions. Acknowledge that this is a demanding activity during their junior and senior years of high school which must be prioritized in their time commitments only behind school and family responsibilities. Junior Member applicants and parents must recognize that while we prioritize school and family as important, some training course schedules and other important events may make scheduling vacations and other events a challenge. Receive a \u201cfit for duty\u201d rating from the Montgomery County Fire/Rescue Operational Medical Service (FROMS). FROMS is a County-contracted occupational medical clinic that administers a comprehensive physical examination including a vision test, hearing test, chest x-ray, tuberculosis screening, cardiac stress test, blood tests, and drug screening. Successfully complete a criminal background check, fingerprinting and inquiries to determine suitability of the applicant for a position of trust in the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad and the Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service. In addition, junior members must have a 2.0 grade point average (GPA) or better to be considered for membership and must agree to maintain a passing GPA. Possess a strong desire to participate in a time-intensive \u201cafter-school\u201d activity during their junior and senior high school years. Parents and junior member applicants need to carefully evaluate the time available in consideration with academic needs, competitive sports, part-time jobs and all the other activities teenagers participate in. Acknowledge that training and certifications earned as a junior member can carry over to regular membership, however, there is no requirement that junior members continue on as adult members. BCCRS may prioritize training spots in certification courses such as EMT to adult members so some junior members may not receive their first choice of training.",
            "To learn more about the training and duty requirements, please visit our website at https://www.bccrs.org/join/junior-members/. Students may earn SSL hours for participating in this volunteer opportunity."

Together they do individual activities that are tailored solely to the needs of the athlete. They may throw a basketball or kick a soccer ball, or they may take a walk around the outdoor track. Many love to bounce on 36\" balls or be pulled along the floor on a flat wheeled scooter. A group may form for Duck, Duck, Goose. The session ends with everyone coming together in a circle (although some athletes still need to run around its periphery, and that's okay) and sharing with the group what they did that day \"that made them very Proud.\" They literally go out dancing: the Hokey Pokey for the younger kids and the Macarena for the teens and young adults. Athletes burn energy, meet and interact with new volunteers, see old friends, and then rejoin their parents, who have had some precious respite time.

            "Please find below a list of virtual/remote opportunities for volunteers to continue reminding Seniors that we are grateful for them. Hospital patients and staff will be heartened by your music and stories. These activities are designed to be completed in the safety of your home during Quarantine for the time being (ending when MCPS and all MD/VA schools return to normal status). If you are interested in volunteering, please complete the following steps: View the orientation video at our website: https://www.tacyfoundation.org/pages/about-us Complete (guardians only) and submit the waiver/release form attached to this opportunity or available on our website: https://www.tacyfoundation.org/pages/about-us Attend one Orientation via telephone Conference Call. Select one or more of the projects below to complete. When an assignment is completed, send as an attachment in an email message to the Teen Intern, to the email address indicated on the attachment given to you for Orientation, and to Charlotte Holliday, at thetacyfoundation@gmail.com. Here is a list of many different virtual/remote opportunities that you can complete until schools return to normal status: 1. Find music that has great meaning for the seniors (songs from 1940's to 1990's). Use the time you would ordinarily spend practicing for an event to learn at least one or two songs. You will be ready to share these favorite songs when the doors open again. During this Fall season, add Fall and Winter repertoire to your list of music to bring after Quarantine. (1 SSL hour) 2. Draw a picture depicting the Summer season for the seniors. Include a crossword puzzle for them to keep their minds sharp. Write a rhyme and picture. Reflect on their importance to your life by their great contributions through history (from 1940's to the present). Send these to the Teen Communications Intern for the Foundation. There have been many adventures from your generous, heroic efforts, and they are so beautiful to read. Sharing your thoughts with other volunteers will embolden them to overcome their fear and hesitancy. Sharing them with adults and seniors reminds the seniors that they are important. It is their privilege to pass down to YOU the great work ethic, sense of purpose, and experiences in grappling with emergencies that they have learned during their lifetime. During this silence from seeing them, we will ask the Communications Intern to receive these writings and place them on Facebook. Most seniors have access to Facebook. They can see their young music friends' messages of concern and of thanks for their lives. We will also mail your messages to them either via email or USPS. (.5 SSL hour) 3. Make and send your music video of music in public domain on YouTube performances. We will offer your music to the Activity Directors (of seniors facilities) as Virtual Live Performance. You are allowed to speak clearly your message to seniors: \u201cI miss seeing you, so I would like to play this song for you now\u2026..\u201d. (1 SSL hour) 4. Write a thoughtful, encouraging email message to a senior. Let the senior know how he or she has reminded you of courage and strength during hard times. You may refer to the Beethoven story written and illustrated below by Faber Piano Adventures. (See web site below on this email message.) https://beethoven.pianoadventures.com/?mc_cid=fe4353e2fc&mc_eid=4e5fc455a7 Tell him or her that you are studying about another hero (besides the senior) who has helped you. In other words, share with seniors in an email message to them to encourage them to be strong and to have hope. Send your letter to the Program Manager: programs.thetacyfoundation@gmail.com. She will send your letter or story to the seniors in all of the places where we play music. They will see our video playlist too and will look forward to the time when COVID is over and we will return to them. 1.5 SSL per email letter. 5 full paragraphs of expressive, encouraging connection between the struggles of Beethoven's life challenges and your experience so far in the pandemic of 2020. 5. Write (and or) illustrate a particular memorable moment when you played music at a hospital. Perhaps someone came up to you and thanked you. Maybe a family had just heard a very sad prognosis, or a family was happily bringing home a newborn baby, or another family was bringing home a loved one from a hospital stay. As they always do, they stopped to hear your music. Another time, perhaps you saw people enter the lobby through the big doors and turn toward the music and sigh a deep breath of hope and courage. Write a descriptive piece on this. Your writing may bring peace of mind to someone in a senior facility or a hospital who cannot express the sadness or the despair. Stories are the best medicine for reminding us of the inestimable value of paying forward our hope for others through music. (1 SSL hour) 6. Write about your Piano Pals\u00ae or Guitar Pals\u00ae or Reading Express\u00ae experiences. Your Reflections may be about a particular life lesson you gained in this setting. Tell about how your Title 1 student saw the world through his or her eyes. Your writing may reflect (1) a change in your idea of community service, (2) what you discovered that you did not know before you taught (Write about this in regard to the children whom you are serving), and/or (3) the importance of music in the lives of the children you are working with. It may include a particularly difficult challenge that you faced or are facing in working with children. The piece may be about how you discovered a side of yourself you had not known before these music classes. Relate how you would like to take what you learned into the world to share with others and to serve again. (1 SSL hour) 7. Assemble USBs for shipments to NYC's First Responders as well as hospital patients. Place USB into plastic pouches with inserts as a donation (1 SSL hour per 100 USBs) 8. Design GET WELL cards for patients. When we ship USBs, we will place your card in the box to the hospital. You will need paper and paint/crayons/color pencils for this. Whatever art supplies you have are fine. Make these generic without reference of religious belief. Hospitals request this. (1 SSL hour for 15 cards) Design CHEERFUL THANK YOU cards for hospitals, First Responders, and the military families that will receive Tacy Foundation USBs at Fisher Houses, and First Responders. (1 SSL hour for 15 cards) 9. The Reading Express Virtual Library: Make a video recording of a children's book, a fairy tale, or Your Own Storybook of holidays in your family. Show the pictures on the camera as you read the book. No matter how difficult life becomes and how trapped a child feels, he or she can go anywhere in the universe with a book or story. Reading to a child can take him anywhere, bring her hope and joy in any life situation. BE SURE THE STORY IS IN PUBLIC DOMAIN or contact the publisher directly first to receive written permission to make a video of the story. (1 hour SSL) 11. Virtual Live Music via YouTube Video Concerts (in Virginia & Maryland) of Music. Prepare songs to play live on YouTube. Chief Interns will place on a private playlist. 45-minute programs are to be sent to Seniors Facilities that request video to be viewed at any time that is convenient for each facility. Look for Signup.com opportunities. Prepare any classical and or public domain songs to cheer each listener! 1.5 hour SSL Credit. Student participation in the above service projects is at the discretion of the student's parent/guardian. The nonprofit organization is responsible for maintaining student safety and privacy. The nonprofit organization will determine the number of SSL hours awarded based on the evidence submitted. Parents/guardians should contact the nonprofit directly with any questions and/or concerns.

            "Several years ago, a senior at a local high school was very worried because it was March 15 and she still needed to complete over 60 SSL hours in order to graduate. She was relatively new to the area and had difficulty connecting with agencies to help her complete her hours. Once she connected with Women Who Care Ministries we scheduled her immediately and she was able to complete our hours in time, with weeks to spare. She told me of the happy, proud faces on her Mom, Dad, Aunt, brother, and Grandmother. She said if we hadn't interceded when we did, likely she would have not been able to graduate. We want you to have a happy ending like Alice! That's why we are again launching our \"Calling All High School Seniors SSL Program, specifically designed for seniors (and juniors, too), to get your hours done in a student-learning environment. We have many flexible hours available, and we will work with your schedule! We are seeking volunteers to: * Collect, bag and sort food for children and families in need, both in our facilities and at local food drives. * Take pictures at our outreach event, enhance our website, powerpoint or newsletters * Answering phones, making posters or other artwork Whatever you like to do we will help you do it with us! We require that you commit to the time you have scheduled and that you come with a great attitude to help others."

Each therapy session requires a team of 3 volunteers, 1 to lead the horse and 2 to work as side aides to assist and maintain the safety of the participant. In therapeutic riding sessions a volunteer has the opportunity to work directly with participants, and contribute to their individual success. A typical session for a volunteer may include a variety of different responsibilities such as: grooming and preparing therapy horses for the sessions; assisting with the preparation of a therapy session such as setting up games, obstacle courses, and more; assisting the participant when walking to the mounting area; being a side aide or horse leader during a riding session; and assisting with maintenance of equipment such as cleaning bridles, saddles and adaptive equipment. Training is required and is provided to all volunteers. The training sessions focus on the importance of safety and therapy protocol.

            "RefAmerica UPDATE for Summer 2020 (virtual) and 2021 (in-person): Hope you all are healthy and staying safe. Yes, RefAmerica is still looking for local American high school students who want to help promote a warm American welcome for refugees in the United States. As we will be unable to bring resettled refugee teens to Washington D.C. this summer for the RefAmerica leadership program, we plan to have a certain number of virtual sessions with a RefAmerica group of teen refugees and volunteers in July 2020 to allow participants to begin their cross-cultural experience, to begin to bond, to begin to develop story-telling and public speaking skills, and to receive some mentoring in anticipation of their in-person program in Washington next summer (2021). If you are a graduating senior, rising senior, or a rising junior, your virtual participation in this program in July 2020 could help lessen the feelings of isolation and frustration experienced by relatively recently arrived refugee teens as they attempt to operate and adapt in a new language and a foreign country during a pandemic lockdown and its aftermath. Support and insights from American peers will be invaluable to them as they try to get know their new home country and its inhabitants under very trying conditions, and volunteers will gain much from refugee insights as well.",
            "We are accepting applications through mid-June and will interview RefAmerica applicants (by phone). (If you are interested in helping welcome refugee peers, we would suggest that this is an ideal time to focus on the RefAmerica application when you are necessarily at home and practicing social distancing.) Those accepted into the program can rest assured that so long as they qualify this year, they will have the opportunity to participate with their refugee contemporaries in the in-person program in Washington next year (health conditions permitting), and we will look to our volunteer teen participants this July to provide much-needed moral support to these refugee peers by participating in a few virtual sessions.",
            "RefAmerica's one-month, Washington-based, in-person program scheduled to be held next in 2021 will, as in previous years, will be held in July for six \u2013 ten recently resettled refugee high school students drawn from around the U.S. and six - ten comparably aged American teens from Montgomery County, MD, and surrounding areas.",
            "RefAmerica is a program in leadership, public-speaking, cross-cultural understanding, and the narrative method. Participants have the opportunity to get to know Washington DC; to learn more about American immigrant stories; to engage in a unique cross-cultural program of sharing traditions, team-building experiences and personal stories; to explore their own roles within a greater American story of immigration and integration; to meet with government and legislative officials, refugee program professionals, and others; and to plan ways to welcome refugees and promote cross-cultural understanding in their home communities. The goal of RefAmerica is to promote full inclusion of recently arrived refugees in America and provide small groups of participant refugees with the tools both to tell their stories and to help forge for themselves, their families and their fellow refugees, like generations of Americans before them, a new American story. Volunteer participants in the July 2021 in-person program are eligible for SSL.",
            "If you would like to participate in RefAmerica program (in-person July 2021 and virtually July 2020) please email refamericafoundation@gmail.com for an application.",
            "We would also welcome hearing from anyone whose parents might want to host a recently resettled refugee high school student for the month of July 2021 or anyone who is just interested in learning more, helping in fund-raising events, or helping in any other way,",
            "Participation in the summer program is competitive and requires an application, short bio, and resume. For this volunteer opportunity, we are looking for friendly, outgoing, supportive students with a commitment to and record of community service. In 2021 (and virtually in 2020), local volunteer participants will join with refugee participants in a wide array of cross-cultural exchange, team-building, and community service activities; build public speaking and leadership skills; and advocate for refugees. They will offer their refugee contemporaries friendship, welcome, and an introduction to teen life in their new home country. In 2021, program participants must make a full four-week commitment (including weekends). In 2020, virtual participation will be 5-8 partial days throughout July (schedule and timing collectively TBD).",
            "RefAmerica is in its fourth year of bringing refugees and local teens together to tell their stories in a summer program of training, shared experience, and cultural exchange.
